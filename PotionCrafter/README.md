    The NPCs (Who are modelled after our lecturers) will ask for a type of potion and as such you are tasked with supplying the demand
    To make the potions required you must collect the ingredients and then prepare them to mix into potions you can then remove them from you inventory and give them to the NPCs.

Resource Collection
    Using WASD to move and your mouse to aim the player will use the magic Cauldron to suck and harvest the resources around the map and add them to your inventory (The White Box is meant to represent the House of the Baba Yaga, Will be updated with a house and the ASDF movie muffin will be updated too) the House will move and the player must follow along will it while collecting the resources during its travel you can then move back around to the other minigame using the icons

Potion Making
    There are 4 stations to making potions however not all are used in making a potion, However most minigame require some timing to make the ingredient you need and can destroy the ingredient if overdone
        In the Grinding minigame place your ingredient into the Mortar and use the pestle to grind it up
        
        In the Boiling minigame place the ingredient into the flask and move it around to start boiling it
        
        In the Slicing Minigame remove your ingredient and use your mouse cursor (Fruit Ninja style) to cut up the ingredients

        Finally the mixing minigame requires you to add your prepared ingrendients into the cauldron and Voila your potion is made.
